# Smart Recycling Bin Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Smart Recycling Bin project! This project aims to simplify waste sorting by automatically detecting and categorizing recyclable materials. With confusion around recycling being a common issue, this smart bin provides an efficient, user-friendly solution to sort recyclables automatically.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the research paper *[A Low-Cost Automated Sorting Recycle Bin Powered by Arduino Microcontroller](https://doi.org/10.1109/SPC.2018.8704146)*, presented at the 2018 IEEE Conference on Systems, Process, and Control. The authors, Harnani Hassan, Fadzliana Saad, and Muhammad Suhaimi Mohd Raklan from Universiti Teknologi MARA, demonstrated the potential of affordable Arduino-powered sorting systems. Their work motivated us to create a similarly accessible and practical recycling solution.

## Purpose
Sorting recyclables can be confusing, and mistakes in recycling can lead to contamination of recyclable materials. This project aims to reduce the human error involved in recycling by automating the sorting process. By using cost-effective technology, this project is suitable for households, schools, and small offices looking for an easy way to manage recycling.

## How It Works
The Smart Recycling Bin uses an Arduino microcontroller with various sensors to detect and sort different types of materials. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

1. **Material Detection**:
   - **Metal Detection**: Identifies metal items and sorts them into the designated metal compartment.
   - **Paper Detection**: Recognizes paper items and directs them to the paper section.
   - **Glass Detection**: Detects glass items and places them in the glass compartment.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Occasionally, the bin may not accurately detect a material. In these cases, users can manually override the sorting by placing the item in the correct bin. This feature ensures that sorting remains efficient even when detection errors occur.

3. **Components Used**:
   - **Arduino Microcontroller**: The core processor that runs the detection algorithms.
   - **Adafruit Sensors**: Used to detect specific materials based on their properties.
   - **Custom Code**: Written to manage the detection, sorting logic, and error handling functions within the bin.

## Workflow
1. The Arduino initiates material detection when an item is placed in the bin.
2. Based on the sensor’s feedback, the bin determines the type of material and directs it to the correct compartment (metal, paper, or glass).
3. If detection is unclear, the system flags it for manual sorting, allowing users to easily handle any undetected items.

## Advantages
- **Cost-Effective**: Uses affordable components, making it an accessible solution for various settings.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed to make recycling easier and error-free.
- **Adaptable**: Can be customized or expanded for specific material types or different environments.

## Conclusion
The Smart Recycling Bin project is a straightforward, practical solution that brings automation to recycling. By making it easy to recycle correctly, we hope this project will promote responsible waste management and reduce the confusion around sorting recyclables.
